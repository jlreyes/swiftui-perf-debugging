# Claude Instruments

A [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) skill that gives Claude programmatic access to Apple Instruments trace data. Instruments is normally a GUI tool — this skill bridges the gap by exporting `.trace` files into DuckDB, where they can be queried with SQL.

## What it does

Given an Instruments `.trace` file, this skill will:

1. **Export** the trace to DuckDB + Parquet (via `export_to_duckdb.py`)
2. **Explore** the exported tables — CPU profiling, hitches, hangs, signposts, Core Animation, SwiftUI updates, RunLoop activity, and more
3. **Prepare** derived views for frame-level analysis (via `prepare_analysis.py`)
4. **Analyze** performance data using SQL queries with full schema knowledge

### Use-case example: SwiftUI scroll jank

The included [scroll-animation.md](scroll-animation.md) companion workflow demonstrates the full power of the skill for diagnosing SwiftUI scroll and animation jank — isolating interaction windows, ranking dropped frames by severity, doing per-frame attribution across SwiftUI/CPU/GPU/RunLoop, cascade analysis, root cause clustering, and producing a prioritized fix plan.

## Install

### As a Claude Code skill

```bash
claude install-skill jlreyes/swiftui-perf-debugging
```

### Manual

Clone and copy the skill files into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlreyes/swiftui-perf-debugging.git
cp -r swiftui-perf-debugging/. your-project/.claude/skills/claude-instruments/
```

## Usage

### 1. Record a trace

```bash
xcrun xctrace record --template 'SwiftUI' --time-limit 20s \
  --output ./traces/recording.trace \
  --attach YourApp --no-prompt
```

Or use the included `PerfDebugging.tracetemplate` in Instruments.

### 2. Export to DuckDB

```bash
./scripts/export_to_duckdb.py traces/recording.trace traces/recording/analysis.duckdb
```

Requires [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (dependencies are managed inline via PEP 723).

### 3. Ask Claude to analyze

```
Analyze the performance trace in traces/recording/analysis.duckdb.
```

For scroll/animation jank specifically:

```
Diagnose the scroll jank in traces/recording/analysis.duckdb.
The laggy scroll happens around 10-20s in the trace.
```
